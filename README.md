AI-Generated Text Detection using CNN-LSTM Hybrid Deep learning model


- leveraging a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify text as either human-generated or machine-generated. The dataset consists of text samples labeled accordingly and applied preprocessing steps such as text vectorization and sequence padding to prepare the data for model training. The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with results showing high performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.35% which is the highest on Kaggle.
